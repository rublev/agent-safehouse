## [0.4.0] - 2026-03-16

### Upgrade Notes

- SSH agent authentication is now opt-in. If you previously relied on `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` inside Safehouse without extra flags, add `--enable=ssh`.
- Packaged releases now ship only `dist/safehouse.sh`. If you consumed `dist/profiles/*` or the generated Claude launcher commands, switch to `dist/safehouse.sh` or generate what you need from source.
- Linked Git worktrees are now auto-detected at launch and sibling worktrees become readable by default. If you want stricter single-worktree visibility, narrow that with `--append-profile` deny rules or disable automatic workdir grants and use explicit path flags.

### Features

- Added linked-worktree support by default: when the effective workdir is a Git worktree root, Safehouse now grants shared Git metadata access for that worktree and read-only visibility into the other existing worktrees for the same repo.
- Expanded Chrome-family browser support on macOS: `chromium-full` now covers system Google Chrome launches, `playwright-chrome` injects `PLAYWRIGHT_MCP_SANDBOX=false`, and `agent-browser` now depends on the full Chrome allowances used by Chrome for Testing.
- Sandboxed commands now get `APP_SANDBOX_CONTAINER_ID=agent-safehouse` by default unless the caller or environment already set a value.

### Bug Fixes

- GitHub Copilot CLI can now bootstrap its startup cache under `~/Library/Caches/copilot`, allowing the packaged launcher to start cleanly on first run.
- SSH agent sockets are denied by default unless `--enable=ssh` is set, closing a gap where agent-backed SSH auth could still work through `network-outbound`.

### Chores

- Reworked the shell/runtime internals into staged CLI, policy, and execution modules, and rebuilt the release packaging around a single embedded `dist/safehouse.sh`.
- Added much broader policy, surface, packaging, and tmux-driven end-to-end coverage to validate behavior and improve release predictability.
- Clarified the default HOME sandbox behavior in the docs, including what `HOME_DIR` does and what the base policy still does not grant.

### Changed Sandboxing Profiles

- [`00-base.sb`](https://github.com/eugene1g/agent-safehouse/compare/v0.3.1...v0.4.0#diff-02c38ee50d8f4793102a508750ddd9d62254a5bef2a70f857fdfdb4f9677acb9): Clarified the `HOME_DIR` base-profile comments so the generated policy docs match the current render pipeline.
- [`ssh-agent-default-deny.sb`](https://github.com/eugene1g/agent-safehouse/compare/v0.3.1...v0.4.0#diff-d5ee2399dc6de3abc866607371d90c0e6a0748d68ab1f31f1b327dc32dd6ea72): Added default-deny rules for launchd and `~/.ssh/agent/*` sockets so SSH agent credential use stays opt-in until `--enable=ssh`.
- [`worktree-common-dir.sb`](https://github.com/eugene1g/agent-safehouse/compare/v0.3.1...v0.4.0#diff-1e29ea236a9b67bfd5f5ab1c7049e9737e9d978f64d4d4c89be7b6974268b8c1): Added runtime-generated grants for a linked worktree's shared Git common dir so refs and index metadata outside the selected workdir keep working.
- [`worktrees.sb`](https://github.com/eugene1g/agent-safehouse/compare/v0.3.1...v0.4.0#diff-17e3dbc495bdbdf1e1e848162114ff08e5a8d92aa06de242f72cde411f3d108a): Added runtime-generated read-only grants for sibling linked worktrees so cross-worktree inspection works by default.
- [`agent-browser.sb`](https://github.com/eugene1g/agent-safehouse/compare/v0.3.1...v0.4.0#diff-51e021c04a1aa945867c71f383a570f1212b5011f7c23a4166781df6b58a0fe3): Switched the dependency to `chromium-full` so the default macOS Agent Browser path works with Chrome for Testing.
- [`chromium-full.sb`](https://github.com/eugene1g/agent-safehouse/compare/v0.3.1...v0.4.0#diff-d542719401c3da098b9f40fa32c7f156af327e4ac8e980ef85b48d73fe7c2e82): Expanded Chrome allowances to cover the system Google Chrome app bundle, prefs, Crashpad state, and Mach rendezvous used during full-browser launches.
- [`keychain.sb`](https://github.com/eugene1g/agent-safehouse/compare/v0.3.1...v0.4.0#diff-a2a140b0b9d2a0c8819f343d379ecafb454d0f47b8b565b18a93a0b7d7bddaae): Clarified that Keychain access is auto-injected transitively from dependent profiles.

- [`ssh.sb`](https://github.com/eugene1g/agent-safehouse/compare/v0.3.1...v0.4.0#diff-27e3f65a24bff6925a3e1e6fca94111fa57ca9cd73e662b4a78b1480804f097d): Extended SSH access to newer `~/.ssh/agent/*` socket layouts and unix-socket connections used by modern macOS ssh-agent setups.
- [`amp.sb`](https://github.com/eugene1g/agent-safehouse/compare/v0.3.1...v0.4.0#diff-7aad0697a20f2d7bbd6001edf23e5259590ca1e4088d5f6f98f4d4ee5ca622ac): Added `/home` compatibility-root reads so Amp startup probes do not fail on macOS path-resolution quirks.
- [`claude-code.sb`](https://github.com/eugene1g/agent-safehouse/compare/v0.3.1...v0.4.0#diff-caf651f708e889ca1935c3c382d551ccbed8eb81f611fab631829993fca117b7): Added the `claude` launcher alias and browser-native-messaging dependency so Claude Code auto-selects correctly and `claude --chrome` works.
- [`copilot-cli.sb`](https://github.com/eugene1g/agent-safehouse/compare/v0.3.1...v0.4.0#diff-4c4b4a874f02531e9888d2fd68d6a7134dd67d9f41db0a08535679e7bd6f8de6): Added the `copilot` launcher alias and writable Copilot cache access so the packaged CLI can bootstrap cleanly.

- [`vscode-app.sb`](https://github.com/eugene1g/agent-safehouse/compare/v0.3.1...v0.4.0#diff-e36692fe5535f876b390e4776cf042e90b6c47a6fe5370200f4013d0ead65cfb): Simplified VS Code's dependency chain so Electron now pulls macOS GUI access transitively while keychain access stays explicit.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-03-12

### Bug Fixes

- Default sanitized execution now preserves common non-secret proxy, TLS, and browser-control environment variables, including `HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`, `NO_PROXY`, lowercase proxy variants, `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS`, and `NO_BROWSER`.
- Tightened Java toolchain sandboxing so system `/Library/Java` runtimes stay read-only while per-user `~/Library/Java` installs remain writable, preventing accidental writes to globally installed JDKs.

### Changed Sandboxing Profiles

- [`profiles/30-toolchains/java.sb`](https://github.com/eugene1g/agent-safehouse/blob/v0.3.1/profiles/30-toolchains/java.sb): Split system and user Java grants so globally installed runtimes are read-only while per-user Java state stays writable.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-03-12

### Features

- New `--enable=xcode` integration: read-only access to Xcode developer roots, app bundles, and Command Line Tools; read/write access to per-user DerivedData, CoreSimulator, XCTestDevices, and CoreDevice state; CoreSimulator and CoreDevice mach service lookups. Enables `xcodebuild`, `simctl`, and `devicectl` under the sandbox.
- `SDKROOT` is now preserved in the default sanitized environment, so Xcode SDK-backed compilation works without `--env`.
- Added `safehouse update [--head]` subcommand for standalone installs to self-update from GitHub release assets or the latest `main` build.

### Bug Fixes

- Node toolchain profile now includes `~/.cache/puppeteer` alongside Playwright and Cypress cache paths.

### Chores

- Bumped NPM docs-site dependencies.
- Refactored live-test denial patterns into shared infrastructure.

### Changed Sandboxing Profiles

- [`profiles/55-integrations-optional/xcode.sb`](https://github.com/eugene1g/agent-safehouse/blob/v0.3.0/profiles/55-integrations-optional/xcode.sb): New profile granting Xcode developer roots plus scoped per-user build and simulator state.
- [`profiles/30-toolchains/node.sb`](https://github.com/eugene1g/agent-safehouse/blob/v0.3.0/profiles/30-toolchains/node.sb): Added Puppeteer cache path (`~/.cache/puppeteer`).
