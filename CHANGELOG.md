### Changed Sandboxing Profiles

## [0.3.0] - 2026-03-12

### Features

- New `--enable=xcode` integration: read-only access to Xcode developer roots, app bundles, and Command Line Tools; read/write access to per-user DerivedData, CoreSimulator, XCTestDevices, and CoreDevice state; CoreSimulator and CoreDevice mach service lookups. Enables `xcodebuild`, `simctl`, and `devicectl` under the sandbox.
- `SDKROOT` is now preserved in the default sanitized environment, so Xcode SDK-backed compilation works without `--env`.
- Added `safehouse update [--head]` subcommand for standalone installs to self-update from GitHub release assets or the latest `main` build.

### Bug Fixes

- Node toolchain profile now includes `~/.cache/puppeteer` alongside Playwright and Cypress cache paths.

### Chores

- Bumped NPM docs-site dependencies.
- Refactored live-test denial patterns into shared infrastructure.

- [`profiles/30-toolchains/node.sb`](https://github.com/eugene1g/agent-safehouse/blob/v0.3.0/profiles/30-toolchains/node.sb): Added Puppeteer cache path (`~/.cache/puppeteer`).
